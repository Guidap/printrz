# Printrz

> Printrz is a bridge between web app and printers installed on the OS.

> It was originally built to send raw ESC/POS commands to thermal printers from a web point of sale but this project can answer other purposes (see API doc for more).

## Introduction
The initial purpose of this application was to send ESC/POS commands to thermal printers from a web app.
Since the API implements the lovely (‚ô•) [node-printer](https://github.com/tojocky/node-printer) project, the API can theorically be used to print PDF, JPG and whatsoever.

Currently, this app is used by GUIDAP's customers to print cash receipt from a desktop device.

### Roadmap to `v1`
- [ ] Fix auto update ([#6](https://github.com/Guidap/printrz/issues/6))
- [ ] Sign app binaries
- [x] Add "Reload printers" button ([#3](https://github.com/Guidap/printrz/issues/3))
- [ ] Show printer state and indicate the default printer of the OS
- [x] Server settings page (host, port) ([#6](https://github.com/Guidap/printrz/issues/5))
- [x] Show local IP on server settings page ([#4](https://github.com/Guidap/printrz/issues/4))
- [ ] Add API Documentation page
- [x] Add self-signed certificates generation for HTTPS origin support ([#6](https://github.com/Guidap/printrz/issues/6))
- [ ] Allow the user to override the default printer
- [ ] Allow the user to chose the best print test between ESC/POS, JPG, PDF and plain text
- [ ] Unit and fonctional testing
- [ ] Create a fancy logo

### Roadmap to `v2`
- [ ] Separate Electron app and API to different projects (the API could be useful as a standalone command line tool)
